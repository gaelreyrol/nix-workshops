# Nix Workshops

> **Warning**
> This is an attempt to create workshops that can be done by complete beginners without having NixOS installed but only Nix.

The main idea is to provide a chain of workshops that do not require any Nix knowledge at the begining. Each step allows to talk about a little part of Nix & NixOS domain without the need of a full understanding. This learn by doing approach should break down the steep learning curve of Nix.

Each workshop contains a ReadMe that should allows the "speaker" to drive it. For now those documents are not documented enough to be done by someone that at least does not have a small Nix experience.

## Workshops

1. [x] [Nix installation](00-nix-installation/ReadMe.md)
2. [x] [Minimal image](01-minimal-image/ReadMe.md)
3. [x] [Custom image](02-custom-image/ReadMe.md)
4. [ ] Homemade package
5. [ ] Standard package override

## ToDo

- [ ] Generate book from mdBook
- [ ] Publish book on Github Pages
