# Introduction

> **Warning**
> This is an attempt to create workshops that can be done by complete beginners without having NixOS installed but only Nix.

The main idea is to provide a chain of workshops that do not require any Nix knowledge at the begining. Each step allows to talk about a little part of Nix & NixOS domain without the need of a full understanding. This learn by doing approach should break down the steep learning curve of Nix.

Each workshop should allow the "speaker" to drive the attendees with a live code session. Those workshops are not documented enough to be led by someone that does not have at least a small experience with Nix.

> **Warning**
> The workshops have only been tested on NixOS and Ubuntu.
