# Introduction

> **Warning**
> This is an attempt to create workshops that can be done by complete beginners without having NixOS installed but only Nix.

The main idea is to provide a chain of workshops that do not require any Nix knowledge at the begining. Each step allows to talk about a little part of Nix & NixOS domain without the need of a full understanding. This learn by doing approach should break down the steep learning curve of Nix.

Each workshop contains a ReadMe that should allows the "speaker" to drive it. For now those documents are not documented enough to be done by someone that at least does not have a small Nix experience.
